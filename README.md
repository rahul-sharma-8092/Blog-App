# PWSkills Blog - Building a Blog Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This is a simple blog application called "PWSkills Blog" that allows users to create and read blog posts. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and all blogs' data will be stored in the browser's LocalStorage.

## Requirements

1. The blog application should have two main pages: the home page and the blog page.

2. On the home page, users should be able to see a list of all existing blog posts with their titles and brief summaries.

3. Users should be able to click on a blog post to view its full content on a separate page.

4. There should be a header with a "+" icon to add a new blog post. Clicking on the icon should open a modal.

5. The add blog modal should contain a form with fields to input the blog title, blog poster, description, and blog content.

6. Upon submitting the add blog form, the new blog post should be added to the list of existing blogs on the home page, and the data should be stored in the LocalStorage.

7. Ensure that the application has a clean and visually appealing design using CSS.
